I'm planning to make more more research in the future. That's why this very specific s2f-monthly-related-script is places in this folder but the more general purpose-scripts are still in the root-folder.

Feel free to create a s2f-daily, a s2fx, analyse the rainbow-charts or whatever. Pull-Requests very welcome!
